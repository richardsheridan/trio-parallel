    By default, :func:`trio_parallel.run_sync` draws workers from a global cache
    that is shared across sequential and between concurrent :func:`trio.run()`
    calls, with workers' lifetimes limited to the life of the main process. This
    covers most use cases, but for the many edge cases, this async context manager
    yields a `WorkerContext` object on which `~WorkerContext.run_sync()` pulls workers
    from an isolated cache with behavior specified by the class arguments. It is only
    advised to use this if specific control over worker type, state, or
    lifetime is required.

    The context will automatically wait for any running workers to become idle when
    exiting the scope. Since this wait cannot be cancelled, it is more convenient to
    only pass the context object to tasks that cannot outlive the scope, for example,
    by using a :class:`~trio.Nursery`.

    Args:
      idle_timeout (float): The time in seconds an idle worker will
          wait for a CPU-bound job before shutting down and releasing its own
          resources. Pass `math.inf` to wait forever. MUST be non-negative.
      init (Callable[[], bool]):
          An object to call within the worker before waiting for jobs.
          This is suitable for initializing worker state so that such stateful logic
          does not need to be included in functions passed to
          :func:`WorkerContext.run_sync`. MUST be callable without arguments.
      retire (Callable[[], bool]):
          An object to call within the worker after executing a CPU-bound job.
          The return value indicates whether worker should be retired (shut down.)
          By default, workers are never retired.
          The process-global environment is stable between calls. Among other things,
          that means that storing state in global variables works.
          MUST be callable without arguments.
      grace_period (float): The time in seconds to wait in when closing for workers to
          exit before issuing SIGKILL/TerminateProcess and raising `BrokenWorkerError`.
          Pass `math.inf` to wait forever. MUST be non-negative.
      worker_type (WorkerType): The kind of worker to create, see :class:`WorkerType`.

    Raises:
      ValueError | TypeError: if an invalid value is passed for an argument, such as a
          negative timeout.
      BrokenWorkerError: if a worker does not shut down cleanly when exiting the scope.

    .. note::

       The callables passed to retire MUST not raise! Doing so will result in a
       :class:`BrokenWorkerError` at an indeterminate future
       :func:`WorkerContext.run_sync` call.

    - Making blocking APIs or infinite loops truly cancellable through
      SIGKILL/TerminateProcess without leaking resources
    - Protecting the main process from unstable/crashy code

    To customize worker behavior, use :func:`open_worker_context`.

    The underlying workers are cached LIFO and reused to minimize latency.
    Global state of the workers is not stable between and across calls.

    Args:
      sync_fn: An importable or pickleable synchronous callable. See the
          :mod:`multiprocessing` documentation for detailed explanation of
          limitations.
      *args: Positional arguments to pass to sync_fn. If you need keyword
          arguments, use :func:`functools.partial`.
      cancellable (bool): Whether to allow cancellation of this operation.
          Cancellation always involves abrupt termination of the worker process
          with SIGKILL/TerminateProcess. To obtain correct semantics with CTRL+C,
          SIGINT is ignored when raised in workers.
      limiter (None, or trio.CapacityLimiter):
          An object used to limit the number of simultaneous processes. Most
